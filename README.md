# discord-fldigi
In development but it works. read through the discordfldigi-bot.py file to see how to configure it. 
This code is badly written with few error checks: take care when using.
~~I need to figure out what liscense to put this under because the transport.py was not made by me; in fact, I have no clue what it does. (I think it requests http access?)~~

This software interfaces a discord channel/bot with fldigi, so you can message using fldigi from discord!
